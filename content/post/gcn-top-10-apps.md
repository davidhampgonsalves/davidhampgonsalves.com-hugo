A few years back I wrote a simple launcher that took advantage of Strava's NFC action intents to automatically start recording a ride. I created some icons for it, named it [One Tap Record for Strava](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onetapstrava&hl=en) and put it in the Play store for others to use.

Fast forward to today, where without a single update or PR campaign the "app" has garnered 100 thousand users and was featured on [GCN's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuTaETsuCOkJ0H_GAztWt0Q) [Top 10 Cycling Apps](https://youtu.be/A4_AJkktqdE?t=203) list.


Such a small, silly triffle, but its been fun to see it go.
