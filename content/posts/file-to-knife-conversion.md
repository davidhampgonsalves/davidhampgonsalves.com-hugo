To learn some of the basics of metallurgy and have an understanding of what goes into some of our most basic tools I built a knife out of a discarded file.

Good quality files are made from high carbon steel which can be annealed (softened) so that it can be worked into a new shape and then hardened to produce a pretty high quality knife.

I mostly followed the excellent [video series](https\://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_jMNsjVc-s]) by Walter Sorrells but with a modified design.
