Latex might be the most fashionable format for the discerning developer but I think its overkill. For my current resume rerwrite I choose markdown because\:

* Its plan text so its easy to **edit** and **version**.
* Its super simple and you are probably already well versed.
* There are already a bunch of nice css templates to work from.
* You can use it to generate most formats you may need.

This is my [resume](http\://www.davidhampgonsalves.com/html/resume.html). Which is generated from this [markdown](https\://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/resume), using [markdown-resume.js](https\://github.com/c0bra/markdown-resume-js).
