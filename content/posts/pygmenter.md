[Pygmenter](http\://pygmntr.appspot.com/) is a web based frontend for the Pygments syntax highlighter. I whipped it up so I that I could write blog entries without leaving my browser and also to help when I'm  unable to install pygments locally on the machine I'm writing from.

## code
As always the code is tucked away in my git hub [repo](https\://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/pygmenter).
