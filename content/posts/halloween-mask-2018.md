I made a cardboard halloween mask powered by an Arduino. Unfortunately it was too scary for the kids when combined with the hunch back and cloak I made so I couldn't wear it.

It has blinking eyes and a breath animation and the code that powers it can be found in [github](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/Halloween-Mask-2018).
