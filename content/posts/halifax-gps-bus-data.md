There are so many Haligonians that want a GPS based Go Time bus tracker. The secret is that the apps and data exist, but that no one ever seems to find them.

The other day that changed for me and I found _(via wikipedia)_ an old broken government webpage that when you looked at the pages source contained a link to\: [mobile departures](http\://eservices.halifax.ca/GoTime/departures_mobile.jsf?goTime=7094).

When combined with the recent bus information released as part of [Halifax's Open Data Project](https\://www.halifaxopendata.ca/) you have everything you need to build a great Bus App.




_Before you run off to build the best bus tracking app ever, keep in mind that 2 already exist\: [transit 360](http\://www.transit360app.com/) and [Halifax Bus](https\://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.busTrack&hl=en)_
