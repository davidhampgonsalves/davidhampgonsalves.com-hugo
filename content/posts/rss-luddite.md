With Google Reader closing its doors the _"Is RSS Dead?"_ debate has been revived.

As someone who loves RSS(enough to write a [Chrome Extension](https\://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/foxish-live-rss/jpgagcapnkccceppgljfpoadahaopjdb?hl=en)) but never liked Google Reader I'd like my turn on the soapbox.

Since my first usage of Firefox(ver 1.5) I have always loved its live bookmarks feature(but not the read/unread indicators).

RSS readers shouldn't be email clones. They should expect us to ignore items and act as a consistent, omnipresent and minimal interface to the internet.

They shouldn't be websites since the click and load times are too great. They should be airy and lightweight and let us fill our fleeting free cycles.


I don't think RSS is dead just misunderstood.
Long live RSS
