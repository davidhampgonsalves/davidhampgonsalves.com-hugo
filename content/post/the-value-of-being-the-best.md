_TLDR: Training data shapes our current iterations of AI and as they get more competitive so will the people who create it._

While its easy to use training data from many individuals(driving habits for example) which might average out to be the best overall it will be hard to optomize for specific attributes(gas millage, passenger comfort).

I think this will create new incentives for being the best at mundane activities.

For example it would be ideal if your autonomous car drove like the highest rated, safest, most full efficient Uber/Lift driver.

This could lead to competitive teams dedicated to the perfection of a routine task solely for the sake of generating a dataset. Or training data reflecting an artists method being more valuable then the artwork itself.
