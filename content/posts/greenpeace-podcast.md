Did a interview about ethical apps on the [Greenpeace Podcast](https\://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/greenpeace-podcast/id675078420?mt=2). Its a great new podcast and I had a great time speaking with them.

## Listen
The podcast is also up on soundcloud so you can hear my [first segment](https\://soundcloud.com/greenpeace-canada/an-app-for-choosing-ethical-foods#t=5\:46) or the [entire show](https\://soundcloud.com/greenpeace-canada/an-app-for-choosing-ethical-foods) from there.
