Everyone has their own *(strong)* opinions about this but I think I've figured it out. First to organize your music [Beets](http\://beets.radbox.org/) is amazing. Its light, easy to use and lets you tweek things exactly how you want them.

The limitation with Beets was that it was just an organizer and you still needed a full GUI application to conveniently find and play your music. This weekend I wrote the Play plugin which lets you harness the might of Beets queries and send those results to your choice of lightweight music player.

*Welcome to light, understandable, configurable, organized and opensource music zen.*

__The [Play plugin](http\://beets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins/play.html) is availiable in Beets 1.3.6.__
