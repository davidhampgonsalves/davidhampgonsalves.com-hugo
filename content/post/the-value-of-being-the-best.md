Training data shapes our current iterations of AI and as they get more competitive so will the search for the best datasets.

While its easy to use training data from many individuals(driving habits for example) which might average out to be the best overall it will be hard to optomize for specific attributes(gas milage, passenger comfort).

I think this will create new incentives for being the best at mundane activities.

For example it would be ideal if your atonomous car drove like the highest rated, safest, most full efficent uber/lift driver.

A team dedicated to the perfection of a routine task solely for the sake of generating a dataset that could then be used to train a superior AI for a given usecase could become the next sport like pursuit.


Rather then an artists artwork being the final product they sell, the training data could be auctioned off and the artwork itself could be generated as needed.
