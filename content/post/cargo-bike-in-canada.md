I've had a [Babboe](http://www.bakfietsen.com/) cargo bike in Toronto for a year now, this is a review of that time.

I've ridden the Babboe every day for a year. Its terrific on the ice and works well in deep snow. Its amazingly useful, and gets my daughter to daycare and back each day. It holds about $200 in groceries plus a child. Its easy to peddle and only takes a few minutes to learn to ride (if you can already ride a bicycle).

Good
====
* Cargo bikes in general are amazingly useful.
* Weathered the Canadian winters well even being stored outdoors under a cover.
* The wooden box is beautiful, solid and durible.
* Fenders and chainguard keep you clean and comfortable even in bad weather.
* Rainhood keeps passengers dry and warm even in the winter.
* The tires are nice but I switched to thinner(35mm) after they wore out which I prefer.

Bad
===
* Although it costs over $3000 the components it uses are low end. A [Bullitt](http://www.larryvsharry.com/) is much nicer but at a higher price point.
* It uses drum brakes which are low maintenence but perform poorly (replaced with higher end ones with minimal improvement).
* The peddles are plastic and get slippery in bad weather (replaced).
* My brake cables developed rust and had to be replaced with better quality ones.
* Rain hood attachment is a bit slow to put on but is great if you can leave it on.

_I bought my Babboe from [Curbside](https://curbsidecycle.com/) which is a great shop._
