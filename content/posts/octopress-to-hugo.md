I ported this blog (and its [theme](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/hugo-black-and-light-theme) from Octopress 2 to Hugo.

The process (which I wont go into detail about since the hugo docs are great) was enjoyable and quick.

Hugo is easy to reason about, amazingly fast, and at least for a simple site like this a much better fit.
