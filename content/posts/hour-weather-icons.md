For Hourly Weather I needed a full set of weather icons that represented a wide palate of weather conditions as well as had night/day versions of each.

I couldn't find an existing set that offered the scope I needed but I did find a set I liked. I can't remember the source now(if anyone does please let me know) but working from that I build up the missing entries. Since the weather is everyones business I thought I'd share them here.
