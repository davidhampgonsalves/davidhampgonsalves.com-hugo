I took part in Digital Oceans Hacktoberfest & had a lot of fun. I ended up pushing some PR's to new projects that I wouldn't have otherwise and got a a t-shirt even though I live in Canada (usually these things are US only). I also noticed an influx in GitHub stickers in my neighbourhood (which were included with the t-shirt) so I assume there must be a few participants in my hood.
